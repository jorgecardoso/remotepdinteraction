@article{Ballagas,
abstract = {In this work, we examine the different types of user interactions and deployment issues surrounding large public displays. We then select and develop a usage paradigm in which people use personal devices to interact with large public displays. Lastly, we present a physical interface for interacting with large public displays based on camera-enabled mobile phones. Our interface uses both Visual Codes and optical-flow processing to support serendipitous interaction with large public displays.},

@article{Myers1998a,
abstract = {The Pebbles project is creating applications to connect
multiple Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) to a main computer
such as a PC. We are using 3Com PalmPilots because
they are starting to be ubiquitous. We created the “Remote
Commander” application to allow users to take turns sending
input from their PalmPilots to the PC as if they were
using the PC’s mouse and keyboard. “PebblesDraw” is a
shared whiteboard application we built that allows all of the
users to send input simultaneously while sharing the same
PC display. We are investigating the use of these applications
in various contexts, such as co-located meetings.},
